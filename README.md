# CDP Management Tools

## Description

This repo contains the code required for installing the CDP components (e.g. CML, CDE, etc.) via the CDP REST API. The code can be run from any host, provided that the dependencies below (env variables and so on) are set up and access to the Cloudera Management Console is available, i.e. Internet access is required. 
The result of each REST API call is checked for success and, in case the expected status is not reached, the execution will time out.
## Repo structure

The repo contains the following folders:

- `conf`: the configurations required for provisioning a complete CDP environment (CDP environment, data lake, CDE, CML and CDW). The configurations are split per stage (e.g. lab, prod, etc.) and CDP environment name. Each CDP environment folder contains the json configuration files, split per CDP components. 

- `scripts`: the Python scripts required for interacting with the CDP REST API. Each CDP component has its own Python script. The CDP REST API requires specific headers, hence the `cdpv1sign.py` is required for signing the headers.
- `pipeline`: the Gitlab yml pipelines

## Expected environment

* **Group level**
  
    **These are required only if the pipeline is run. For running manually the code they are not needed.**
  * **DOCKER_REGISTRY** : The URI of the Artifactory repository where to store the container created
  * **ARTIFACTORY_USER** : the username to access our repository
  * **ARTIFACTORY_PASS** : the corresponding password
  * **DOCKER_AUTH_CONFIG** : a variable containing the following but also when automatically pulling images from a protected artifactory repository such as ours.

    ```json
    {"auths": { "artifactory.sofa.dev": { "auth": "$CI_DOCKER_AUTH" }}}
    ```  

    where **CI_DOCKER_AUTH** is a *base64* encoded and masked variable containing the artifactory credentials (in the form of *username:password*)

* **Project level**
  For interacting with CDP we are going to use a technical user's CDP credentials (i.e. access key and password). For now, these credentials are stored in Gitlab however they would need to be migrated to a safer store, e.g. AWS Secrets Manager. 
  
  This user is an IGAM technical user and, after it is created, a SAML login to the CDP management console is required in order to populate it in the CDP UMS. Please be aware that IGAM SSO searches the `OU=Users and Groups,OU=ECB,DC=ecb01,DC=ecb,DC=de` branch, hence the technical user needs to be provisioned in that OU (other applications such as MoMo did the same for their monitoring users).
  Request type to be used in ITSP: Requests to create, modify, extend, delete non-Standard/-SA account in DEV AD environments.
  Technical user name: ap-devo-cdp

  * **CDP_ACCESS_KEY_ID** : The access key of the CDP technical user.
  * **CDP_PRIVATE_KEY** : The private key of the CDP technical user.
Find the CDP admin group in User Management and click on its Admins tab (https://console.cdp.cloudera.com/iam/index.html#/groups/ecbt1-igamfs-app-cdp-admin?tab=admins). Add the technical user.
User ap-devo-cdp has been assigned resource role IamGroupAdmin for ecbt1-igamfs-app-cdp-admin.
  * **REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE**:
    - /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/openssl/ca-bundle.trust.crt for RHEL/Amazon Linux
    - /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt for Ubuntu/Alpine


* **Python dependencies**

## Terraform prerequisites for installing CDP components
Before installing any CDP component we need to make sure that the underlying AWS infrastructure is provisioned in the ECB AWS account. For this, we are going to use the IaC repo (e.g. for lab https://gitlab-ccoe-hyhop.ecbcloud.xyz/cloud/aws/iac/product-teams/devo2/devo2-lab).Â 
Please make sure that the IaC code was ran before continuing. 
**Important mention: CDW requires a specific way of provisioning which could not be fully automated. You will find the instructions for it at the end of this README**

## Prerequisites for running the code
- SSH access to the DEVO2 jumphost is possible. Please check the https://gitlab.sofa.dev/ddp/devo/aws-jumphost-setup repo for more details.
- The jumphost should have already been configured for you via the same repo., hence a Python environment is already available for you there.
- For now, the SoFa pipeline is not ready, hence the code will be run from the jumphost.
- **Important note**: The python scripts have a `--dryrun` option so that nothing gets executed but you will be able to see all the actions that will be done together with the JSON that would be posted to the CDP REST API endpoint. Please use the `--no-dryrun` flag when initiating a "real" execution.
- When running the code examples below please export the CA bundle certificate location and the environment name.
    ```bash
    export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/openssl/ca-bundle.trust.crt
    export DEVO_ENV_NAME=devo-lab04
    export ECB_ENV=lab
    ```
- Please make sure that the cluster names you use as parameters are reflected in the `conf/<env>/<cdp_env>` corresponding folder. E.g.: the CML cluster you specify is defined in the `cml.json` file of that environment.
## CDP Tenant configuration
- Assign the cdp roles to the admin groups
    ```bash
    cdp iam assign-group-role --generate-cli-skeleton > asg_group_role.json && \
    python3 scripts/group_cdp_role_map.py --no-dryrun --env ${ECB_ENV} --action assign --json-skel asg_group_role.json
    ```

## CDP environment actions
### Prerequisites for installing a new CDP environment
The steps below show how to install CDP components(environment, datalake, CDE, CML, etc.) from scratch. **Please follow the installation order below: CDP environment, CDP data lake, CDP experiences**.
- Please see the section called "Running the code" for exporting the proper environment variables
- When creating a new environment please create a new folder containing the CDP environment name in the `conf` folder following the convention `devo-<stage><env_number>`, e.g. `devo-lab04`.
- Create the json configuration files corresponding to the CDP components in the previously mentioned folder (e.g. `cde.json`, `cml.json`, `cdw.json`, etc.). **Please fill all the required details belonging to that environment (VPC ID, security groups, subnets, role names, public key, account id, etc.)**. You can use one of the existing folders as an example.

### Create the credential for the environment

```bash
cdp environments create-aws-credential --generate-cli-skeleton > cred_create.json && \
python3 scripts/cred_mgmt.py --no-dryrun --action create --env ${ECB_ENV} --cdp-env-name ${DEVO_ENV_NAME} --json-skel cred_create.json
```

### Create the CDP environment

```

### Create ranger and idbroker mappings

**Please be aware that when you add new roles and run the script below, the users have to login first in CDP so that their `accessorCrn` gets populated**
TODO: Populate users automatically
```bash
cdp environments set-id-broker-mappings --generate-cli-skeleton > create_idbroker_mapping.json && \
python3 scripts/idbroker_map.py  --no-dryrun --env ${ECB_ENV} --cdp-env-name ${DEVO_ENV_NAME} --json-skel create_idbroker_mapping.json

## Enabling the CDW service
For enabling the CDW service we are going to use the following procedure. **This is only needed when enabling the CDW service; for installing the virtual warehouses you will use the steps in the "Install CDW Virtual Warehouse" section**.
- Please make sure that you have followed the previous steps for creating a CDP environment and a datalake for it. 
- This procedure is based on the official Cloudera one here: https://docs.cloudera.com/data-warehouse/cloud/aws-environments/topics/dw-aws-reduced-perms-mode-activating-environments.html

- Please be aware that there is only one CDW service you can deploy per CDP environment. Please check that there is no CDW instance already running in your env in the CDP MC. If that is the case, please follow the steps in the "Disabling the CDW service" chapter below.  
- Open the CDP MC (e.g. `https://t-igam.tadnet.eu/oamfed/idp/initiatesso?providerid=CDP` for TADNET), click on Data Warehouse, click on the lighting bolt for the specific environment where you want to provision CDW then:
- Choose only private subnets as Deployment Mode
- Choose all 3 BE networks in the Private Subents area
- Check use overlay nw
- Click Activate and then check to activate environment with reduced permissions mode.
- Click Activate
- Copy the CDW environment (e.g. `env-5frx9b`)
- **devo2-modules SoFa repo**: The module for provisioning CDW (`cdp_cdw_infra`) should be already in your `envs/<env_name>/main.tf` file from when you provisioned the CDP environment. In case you want to do development on this repo please create a feature branch (e.g. `feature/12345`).
- **devo2 IaC repo**
  - Fill in the following variables in the `env.tf` (e.g. `devo2-lab/env.tf`) in the corresponding environment information section: 
    - `cdw_env_name` (the one you copied from the CDW CDP console), 
    - `delete_cdw` (should be set to `false`).
    ```bash
    devo-lab04 = {
      cdp_env_info    = local.cdp_env_info
      liftie_env_info = local.liftie_env_info
      cdw_env_info = merge(
        local.cdw_env_info,
        { 
          cdw_env_name = "env-hk574w",
          delete_cdw   = false
        }
      )
    }
    ```
    - In case you are working with a custom branch in `devo2-modules` please replace the branch name in all git URLs in the `main.tf` with the branch name you just created. E.g.: `"git::https://oauth2:UtHHpqCf1-1QDzU2_DBd@gitlab.sofa.dev/ddp/devo/devo2-modules.git//devo-discdata-s3-access-v2?ref=feature/blabla"`. Otherwise just work with the `develop` branch and no changes are needed.
  - Run TF pipeline
- Once this is done, go back to the CDP Data Warehouse interface and then 
  - click on Copy Configurations, 
  - optionally copy the kubeconfig file contents (can be retrieved later via the `aws` cli)
  - tick `Yes, Kubeconfig and AWS Auth configurations are applied` and then Continue. 
  - Wait until the service is enabled and the Database Catalog is provisioned.
- Login to the JH and then enable the Cloudwatch logging for EKS:

    ```bash
    â  aws eks update-cluster-config --name env-hk574w-dwx-stack-eks --logging '{"clusterLogging": [{"types": ["api","audit","authenticator","controllerManager","scheduler"],"enabled": true}]}'
    ```
- **devo2-modules SoFa repo**: In case you created a custom branch, merge your branch to the `develop` branch once you have finished work on that branch.
- **devo2 IaC repo** : In case you created a custom branch in the `devo2-modules` repo, please replace the branch name in all git URLs in the `main.tf` with the `develop` branch.
- Follow the steps for provisioning the virtual warehouses in the "Installing a CDW Vitual Warehouse" section.

### Install CDW Virtual Warehouse (Impala/Hive)
```bash
cdp dw create-vw --generate-cli-skeleton > create_vw.json && python3 scripts/vw_cdw_mgmt.py --no-dryrun --action install --env ${ECB_ENV} --cdp-env-name $DEVO_ENV_NAME --vw-name i03 --json-skel create_vw.json
```

### Delete CDW Virtual Warehouse (Impala/Hive)
TODO: Add example

## Disabling the CDW service
- Disable the CDW service via the CDP REST API
  ```bash
  cdp dw delete-cluster --generate-cli-skeleton > delete_dw.json && python3 scripts/cdw_mgmt.py --no-dryrun --action delete --env ${ECB_ENV} --cdp-env-name $DEVO_ENV_NAME --json-skel delete_dw.json
  ```

- SSH to the DEVO2 jumphost and run the following commands. This is required since the CDW ACM certificate is in use by an ELB. However, this ELB is not part of the CDW CF stack and it is created separately by EKS. For this reason, deleting the CF stack will fail without executing the steps below. 
  ```bash
  export DEVO_ENV_NAME=devo-lab04
  export CRT_ARN=$(aws acm list-certificates --query 'CertificateSummaryList[].[CertificateArn,DomainName]' --output text | grep $DEVO_ENV_NAME | cut -f1)
  export ALB_NAME=$(aws elb describe-load-balancers --query "LoadBalancerDescriptions[? ListenerDescriptions [? Listener.SSLCertificateId =='$CRT_ARN' ]]" | jq -r ".[0].LoadBalancerName")
  aws elb delete-load-balancer-listeners --load-balancer-name $ALB_NAME --load-balancer-ports 443
  ```
- **devo2 IaC repo**
  - Please set the `delete_cdw` to `true`in the `env.tf` (e.g. `devo2-lab/env.tf`)
    ```bash
    devo-lab04 = {
      cdp_env_info    = local.cdp_env_info
      liftie_env_info = local.liftie_env_info
      # cdp environment names; the values are the cdw environment names; if there is no cdw configured for that environment please leave the value empty #
      cdw_env_info = merge(
        local.cdw_env_info,
        { 
          cdw_env_name = "env-hk574w",
          delete_cdw   = true
        }
      )
    }
    ```
  - Run TF pipeline

- **devo2 IaC repo**
  - Please set the `cdw_env_name` to "" in the `env.tf` (e.g. `/devo2-lab/env.tf`)
    ```bash
    devo-lab04 = {
      cdp_env_info    = local.cdp_env_info
      liftie_env_info = local.liftie_env_info
      # cdp environment names; the values are the cdw environment names; if there is no cdw configured for that environment please leave the value empty #
      cdw_env_info = merge(
        local.cdw_env_info,
        { cdw_env_name = "",
          delete_cdw   = true
        }
      )
    }
    ```
  - Commit and push your changes.
## Allow the jumphost role admin access to the EKS CP for CDE or CML
  - **devo2 IaC repo**: Re-run the DEVO2 TF code for enabling https access to the EKS Control Plane. Since no changes were performed in this repo then you need to do some dummy change (e.g. a comment) in one of the files of the repo in order to be able to issue a merge request.
  - SSH to the jumphost
  - Export the variables
  ```bash
  export DEVO_ENV_NAME=devo-lab04
  export EKS_CLUSTER_NAME=liftie-sx44dbft
  export EKS_CLUSTER_TYPE=cml
  export ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)
  ```
  - Assume the crossaccount role
  ```bash
  cred=$(aws sts assume-role --role-arn arn:aws:iam::${ACCOUNT_ID}:role/${DEVO_ENV_NAME}-crossaccount-role  --role-session-name AWSCLI-Session | jq .Credentials)
  export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(echo $cred|jq .AccessKeyId|tr -d '"')
  export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(echo $cred|jq .SecretAccessKey|tr -d '"')
  export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=$(echo $cred|jq .SessionToken|tr -d '"')
  ```
  - Retrieve the kubeconfig file and export the `KUBECONFIG` variable
  ```bash
  aws eks update-kubeconfig --name $EKS_CLUSTER_NAME --kubeconfig ~/.kube/${DEVO_ENV_NAME}-${EKS_CLUSTER_TYPE}
  export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/${DEVO_ENV_NAME}-${EKS_CLUSTER_TYPE}
  ```
  
  - Create the aws-auth configmap file
  ```bash
  cd cdp-mgmt
  kubectl get configmap aws-auth --namespace kube-system -o yaml | python3 scripts/dump_aws_auth.py > aws_auth_${DEVO_ENV_NAME}-${EKS_CLUSTER_TYPE}
  ```
  - Apply the configmap update
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f aws_auth_${DEVO_ENV_NAME}-${EKS_CLUSTER_TYPE}
  ```

  - Test that it works by exiting and logging in again to the host and running the commands below.
  ```bash
  export DEVO_ENV_NAME=devo-lab04
  export EKS_CLUSTER_TYPE=cde
  export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/${DEVO_ENV_NAME}-${EKS_CLUSTER_TYPE}
  kubectl get po -A | head -5
  ```
## Pipeline - work in progress for now

To a certain extent, we are abusing the traditional concept of a pipeline, since the pipeline does not contain the traditional stages (build/test/deploy). We are building a "poor man's" dynamic pipeline based on the environment variable `ACTION`. The action can be one of the following:

* install (installs a CDP environment and its attached datalake)
* delete (deletes a CDP environment and its attached datalake)
* start (starts a CDP environment and its attached datalake)
* stop (stops environment and its attached datalake)
* install_cml (installs CML cluster)
* delete_cml (deletes a CML cluster)
* install_cde (installs a CDE cluster)
* delete_cde (deletes a CDE cluster)

Based on the value of this variable, a deployment pipeline will be generated on the fly containing the steps for that specific action. E.g. selecting `install_cml` will render a pipeline containing two stages: start the CDP environment and provision the CML cluster.
Most of the actions are manual in order to allow the user to confirm the action he wants to perform.
